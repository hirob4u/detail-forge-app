# DetailForge — Agent Instructions

**READ `AGENTS.md` BEFORE DOING ANYTHING.** This is mandatory. Every session, every task, no exceptions.

## Session Start Sequence

Every new session must execute these steps in order before any work begins:

1. Read `AGENTS.md` — understand the stack, conventions, and errata
2. Run `/cartographer` — build/update the living codebase map
3. Read `forge/patterns.md` — check active warnings from prior sessions
4. Announce: "Session initialized. [N] active forge warnings. Ready for Blueprint."

Do not skip this sequence. Do not start coding before completing it.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

### 1. Blueprint Required
No changes without an approved Blueprint. Spec must include: branch name, commit message, files affected, errata to apply, what gets built. Get Ben's approval before writing code. No exceptions for "small" or "chore" tasks.

### 2. Crucible Skill Checklist (every Blueprint)
| Phase | Skill | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Before code | `/cartographer` | Consult codebase map |
| Before code | `/forge` feed-forward | Read `forge/patterns.md` for warnings |
| During code | `/test-driven-development` | Write tests before implementation (skip only for doc-only changes) |
| Before commit | `/quality-gate` | Red-team changes. Do not commit until gate passes or stagnation detected |
| After PR | `/forge` retrospective | Record lessons immediately. Do not end session without it |
| After PR | Errata + patterns | Update `docs/blueprint-errata.md` and `forge/patterns.md` in the repo. Commit to the PR branch |

If skipping any step, state which and why. Silence is not consent to skip.

### 3. Build Log + Errata + Forge (Three-File Rule)
Every commit that touches `src/` or `drizzle/` **must** stage all three files:
1. **`docs/build-log.md`** — what was built, what worked, what was corrected
2. **`docs/blueprint-errata.md`** — lessons learned and "Add to Blueprint" entries
3. **`forge/patterns.md`** — forward-looking warnings for future sessions

If a commit has no errata or patterns to record, add a dated "No new errata" / "No new patterns" entry — do not leave the file unstaged. A PreToolUse hook (`.claude/hooks/pre-commit-forge-gate.sh`) enforces this at commit time and will block the commit if any of the three files is missing from staging. These files live in the repo (not just agent memory) so future sessions and agents can read them.

### 4. Visual Verification
All font, icon, image, and asset changes must be visually verified before committing. Render → inspect → confirm → then commit. Never assume rendering is correct.

### 5. Code Quality Gates
- TypeScript strict mode. Zero `any`. Fix all TS errors before task completion.
- ESLint must pass clean before task completion.
- No hardcoded design values — import from `lib/design-tokens.ts`.
- No hardcoded column names — reference `lib/schema.ts`.

### 6. Security & Secrets
- Never commit `.env`, `.env.local`, or any file containing secrets.
- Never log secrets, API keys, or connection strings.
- Never hardcode credentials in source files.
- R2 buckets are private. Never store public URLs — store object keys only.

### 7. Git Discipline
- Always sync with remote main before creating a branch: `git checkout main && git pull origin main`
- Never commit directly to main.
- One Blueprint per branch. Branch naming: `type/short-descriptor`
- All branches merge to main via PR reviewed by Ben.
- Clean up local branches after merge.

### 8. Error Handling
- When unsure about a spec detail, use the most conservative interpretation.
- Leave `TODO: VERIFY` comments for ambiguous decisions so Ben can review.
- If a build fails, diagnose the root cause. Do not retry blindly.
- If a skill fails to invoke, report it — do not silently skip.

## Architecture Quick Reference
- **Stack:** Next.js 16 App Router, React, TypeScript, Tailwind v4, shadcn/ui, Better Auth, Neon PostgreSQL, Vercel, Cloudflare R2
- **Proxy:** `src/proxy.ts` (NOT middleware.ts)
- **Auth routes:** Add to `PROTECTED_PREFIXES` and `config.matcher` in `proxy.ts`
- **Org ID:** Always resolve via `getDetailForgeOrgId()` — never use `activeOrganizationId` directly
- **AI prompts:** Stored in DB `prompts` table, never hardcoded
- **Fonts:** DM Sans (UI), JetBrains Mono (numbers/badges), Lazer84 (wordmark only)
- **Domain:** `detailforge.io` (apex, no www)

## V1.1 Reference Docs
Before starting any v1.1 Blueprint, read the relevant decision doc:
- `docs/v1.1-methodology-engine.md` — Detailer Methodology Engine + Blueprint sequence
- `docs/v1.1-baseline-architecture.md` — Baseline-first estimate architecture
- `docs/v1.1-supply-cabinet.md` — Supply cabinet, job recommendations, reorder reminders
